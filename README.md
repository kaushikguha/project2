<img src="public/css/assets/inv.jpg" width="200"> 

## User Story

The inventory management app allows users to easily update and manage their inventories for retail outlets including restaurants and stores. This app will allow users to make updates on the fly which get stored and updated to a MongoDB database.

The users have to initially log in to the app to be able to make changes.
Once logged in, they can add, review, delete, or update various inventory items.

The user can update the details of the items and also place an 'order' if the item is running low. This order is captured with a time stamp and user for later reference.


## Routes

The routes included are:

1. POST route to create new inventory items
2. GET to show a list of all inventory items in summary (Index)
3. PUT route to update the inventory items
4. DELETE route to destroy an inventory item

There are other GET routes and POST routes for the sessions as well as order capturing.
